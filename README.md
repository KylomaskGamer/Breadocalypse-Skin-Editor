# Breadocalypse-Skin-Editor
Skin generator for the game Breadocalypse.
## How it works
Basically you need to import a bunch of `.svg` files, adjust, and make sure each frame is set.

## ok but how
- Idle / Walk 1 / Walk 2 etc. - Click to change the frame you wanna work on
- Shove in SVG - Upload an svg and it wil spawn on screen
- Adjust - Automatically finds the size of the thing, **THIS AFFECTS ALL SPRITES** so i suggest adjusting the Idle sprite
- Export - Unlocked after all 6 frames have SVGs, this is where you name your fella and yeah
